# 🚀 SwiftSend – Bulk Personalized Gmail Sender

SwiftSend is a lightweight Chrome extension that helps you send **individualized emails in bulk** using your Gmail account — with support for personalization, attachments, and a clean, Gmail-native experience.

Whether you're:
- Reaching out to recruiters,
- Sending personalized event invites,
- Or running cold outreach campaigns —

**SwiftSend** automates the repetitive task of sending the same email, one at a time — with a personal touch.

## 🔑 Features

✅ Send individual emails to multiple recipients  
✅ Personalize each email with recipient-specific greetings (e.g., *Dear Alex*)  
✅ Attach files (e.g., resumes, brochures)  
✅ Rich text formatting support (bold, line breaks)  
✅ Built with Google OAuth 2.0 + Gmail API — **secure and no third-party access**  
✅ Works directly through your Gmail account

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Input comma-separated email addresses  
2. Input comma-separated recipient names (in the same order)  
3. Type your subject and message body (supports basic formatting like bold)  
4. Upload a file to attach  
5. Hit **Submit** — SwiftSend will:
   - Authenticate you via Gmail
   - Send each recipient a separate email with:
     - Their name inserted at the top (e.g., *Dear Alex,*)
     - The common subject and body
     - Your attachment
